# Overview

A Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL). Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP-messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other Web-related standards ([Web Services Glossary](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-ws-gloss-20040211/#webservice)).

WaveMaker makes it easy to integrate external web services within your app. You need to import and configure a web service and invoke the same using a variable which can be bound to a widget for data rendering.

You can use the following types of web services:

- **REST services:** A REST (Representational State Transfer) web service is composed of resources accessed through unique URLs (requests) and returned as XML or JSON responses. An XML Schema typically defines the structure of those XML responses.
- **SOAP services:** SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a standard XML protocol for exposing and calling web services. A SOAP service is described by a Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) document, often available through a URL from the service itself.
- **WebSocket services:** WebSockets represent the next evolution of web communications a full-duplex, bidirectional communications channel that operate through a single socket over the Web. It provides a true standard that you can use to build scalable, real-time web applications. It provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Its only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by HTTP servers as an Upgrade Request.

# Variables for invocation

After importing a web-service, a **Variable** needs to be created manually for each method of the service, which actually triggers the service in the RUN mode of the app and stores the data returned by the service in its _dataSet_ property (_variableName.dataSet_). You can use this _dataSet_ as any other variable. While binding a widget with a variable’s _dataSet_, it is assumed that the binding chain is following pure JSON structure and there is no array on any of the nodes. Any deviations to this structure need to be addressed from the markup manually. In some cases, modification with _dataSet_ may be required, which needs to be done at the variable level.
