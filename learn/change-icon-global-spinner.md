---

The icon that is displayed at the time of page load, data load etc., is defined by a _wm-spinner_ tag defined in the _index.html_. You can set it to any Font-Awesome icon using the corresponding icon class, for eg: "fa fa-hourglass-o fa-spin fa-lg" You can change it using the following steps:

1. From the left pullout menu Files tab, select Project from the drop down, and locate _index.html_
2. Add the icon class property to the "wm-spinner" tag
3. Save the index.html page and run the application.
