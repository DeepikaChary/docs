Handling one-to-many relation scenarios is very easy within WaveMaker. Going with the example of sample database, we will see how to display Employee details for a selected Department. [![run](/learn/assets/run-1024x576.png)](/learn/assets/run.png)

1. [Import the Sample HRDB](/learn/jump-start/#db)
2. Drag and drop a [Data Table](/learn/data-table/)
    1. CREATE NEW Variable with **hrdb** as service and **Department** as the **Operation/Type** [![dt1_dept_data](/learn/assets/dt1_dept_data.png)](/learn/assets/dt1_dept_data.png)
    2. Select any **layout** of your choice, here we have selected _Read-only_ [![dt1_dept_layout](/learn/assets/dt1_dept_layout.png)](/learn/assets/dt1_dept_layout.png)
    3. Select the **Name**, **Deptid** and **Budget** [![dt1_dept_fields](/learn/assets/dt1_dept_fields.png)](/learn/assets/dt1_dept_fields.png)
