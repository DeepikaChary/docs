Customising Data Table using Advanced SettingsData Table widget allows you to customise the columns. The customisation options are available from the **Advanced Settings** property of a **Data Table** widget.

Customisation of Data Table can be in terms of:

- using **Widgets** to represent the edit and display options
- changing **Format** options for custom fields
- **Styling** of the columns using Class and Conditional Class definitions
- Column **security**
- Customising **Actions Column**

We will be using a Data Table bound to Employee Live Variable from the sample database that ships with WaveMaker. The Data Table displays the following fields: Firstname, Lastname, Zip, Birthdate, Picurl, Department Name, and Department Budget.

[![dt_as](/learn/assets/dt_as-1024x640.png)](/learn/assets/dt_as.png) Widgets for Edit and Display of ColumnsWidgets can be used for two purposes:

- **Edit Options**: This option is available for _Inline Editable Data Table_. This defines the _format for data input_ by the user. The options include **text**, **number**, **textarea**, **select**, **autocomplete**, **checkbox**, **date**, **time**, **datetime**, and **upload**. These behave the same way as for a Live Form.
- **View Options**: View option defines the presentation of data to the user. The available options are: **button**, **checkbox**, and **image**.

## Image widget options

- _Widget Class_ - style class for the entire column
- _Conditional Widget Class_ - specify the style class name to be applied to select rows satisfying the given condition.
- _Image Source_ - by default it is populated with the column name, it can be replaced with any external source path.
- _Value Expression_ - You can write a custom expression to change the display setting for a table column. The expression needs to follow AngularJS conventions for binding. A sample expression is given which can be enhanced as per the needs of the application.

## Button widget options

- _Widget Class_ - style class for the entire column
- _Conditional Widget Class_ - specify the style class name to be applied to select rows satisfying the given condition.
- _Widget Title_ - title to be displayed on the button at run-time, set by default to the column name, can be edited as per the needs
- _Widget Icon_ - icon name, including the class name for example: glyphicon glyphicon-home
- _Widget Action_ - method, as defined in Script, to be invoked on the click event of the button. The method will be auto-generated upon the selection of JavaScript option with a parameter set to _selectedItem_.
- _Value Expression_ - You can write a custom expression to change the display setting for a table column. The expression needs to follow AngularJS conventions for binding. A sample expression is given which can be enhanced as per the needs of the application.

## Checkbox widget options

- _Widget Class_ - style class for the entire column
- _Conditional Widget Class_ - specify the style class name to be applied to select rows satisfying the given condition.
- _Disable_ - code example given to disable the checkbox in the table
- _Value Expression_ - You can write a custom expression to change the display setting for a table column. The expression needs to follow AngularJS conventions for binding. A sample expression is given which can be enhanced as per the needs of the application.

## Usage Example

We will customise the Data Table:

- Firstname field as a primary button
- Lastname field as danger button with a click event triggering the display of alert notification variable
- Picurl as an image widget

[![dt_widget_run](/learn/assets/dt_widget_run-1024x640.png)](/learn/assets/dt_widget_run.png) Click on the any Lastname button [![dt_widget_run2](/learn/assets/dt_widget_run2-1024x640.png)](/learn/assets/dt_widget_run2.png)

1. Firstname field as a primary button [![dt_button](/learn/assets/dt_button.png)](/learn/assets/dt_button.png)
2. Lastname field as danger button with a click event triggering the display of alert notification variable: Set the Widget to button, Widget class to btn-danger, Widget Action to New Notification Variable. Design the Notification Variable to display an alert box with the message 'Testing' [![dt_button_danger](/learn/assets/dt_button_danger.png)](/learn/assets/dt_button_danger.png)[![dt_button_alert](/learn/assets/dt_button_alert.png)](/learn/assets/dt_button_alert.png)
3. Picurl as an image widget, [![dt_widget_image](/learn/assets/dt_widget_image.png)](/learn/assets/dt_widget_image.png)

Column Formatting OptionsThe Format options available are: prefix, suffix, toCurrency, toDate and toNumber. Depending upon the option selected further choices open up:

## Prefix/Suffix Options:

- Prefix/Suffix value can be specified

## Currency Options:

- Symbol by name can be selected from the drop-down list and the currency symbol will be inserted in the column
- Fraction Size can be set

## Data Options:

- Date Pattern can be selected from the drop-down list

## Number Options:

- Fraction Size can be set

Be aware that these format types selected are only for display purpose. During runtime, edit row will display the values as defined at the data source.

## Usage Example

We will customise the Data Table:

1. 1. Zip with a prefix of ‘US-‘
    2. Birthdate formatted to toDate with Date Pattern as ‘yyyy, MMM dd’
    3. Department Name with a suffix of ‘Dept’
    4. Department Budget formatted as toCurrency with ‘USD’ symbol and Fraction Size ‘2’

[![dt_format_run](/learn/assets/dt_format_run-1024x640.png)](/learn/assets/dt_format_run.png)

- Zip with a prefix of ‘US-‘, [![dt_format_pre](/learn/assets/dt_format_pre.png)](/learn/assets/dt_format_pre.png)
- Birthdate formatted to toDate with Date Pattern as ‘yyyy, MMM dd’, [![dt_format_date](/learn/assets/dt_format_date.png)](/learn/assets/dt_format_date.png)
- Department Name with a suffix of ‘Dept’, [![dt_format_suff](/learn/assets/dt_format_suff.png)](/learn/assets/dt_format_suff.png)
- Department Budget formatted as toCurrency with ‘USD’ symbol and Fraction Size ‘2’ [![dt_format_curr](/learn/assets/dt_format_curr.png)](/learn/assets/dt_format_curr.png)

Column Styling OptionsStyling options include

- **Width** for the column which can be specified in terms of the **Width Unit** - _px_ or _%_
- **Text Alignment** of the column content
- **Background** color for the column can be set
- CSS **Class** for styling the field, this needs to be under the Style tab of the Page
- **Conditional Class** for custom styling the column based on a condition

## Usage Example

We will customise the Data Table:

- - Department Budget column to be displayed in pink color
    - Zip column to be in blue when the value is 90028

[![dt_style_run](/learn/assets/dt_style_run-1024x640.png)](/learn/assets/dt_style_run.png)

The following style classes have been defined from the Style tab:

.pink {
    background-color: #F8E0E0;
}
.blue {
    background-color: #CEF6F5;
}
.green {
    background-color: #D8F6CE;
}

[![dt_style](/learn/assets/dt_style.png)](/learn/assets/dt_style.png)

From the Advanced Settings dialog:

1. select Department Budget field and set the Class under Style tab to pink [![dt_style_class](/learn/assets/dt_style_class.png)](/learn/assets/dt_style_class.png)
2. _Conditional Column Classes_ - specify the style class name to be applied to select rows satisfying the given condition. For example, you want to display the cell for Zip value of 90028 in blue [![dt_style_cond](/learn/assets/dt_style_cond.png)](/learn/assets/dt_style_cond.png)

Table and Column ActionsActions Tab can be used to define the actions at grid and row level. By default the following actions are given:

- **New** table-level action to insert rows into the database table
- **updaterow** and **deleterow** to modify and delete rows

You can add custom actions:

- **Data Table Actions** are button type widgets with click **Actions** to be specified in the Script. The **location** of these buttons can be specified to be in the _Footer_ or _Header_
- **Row Actions** come with an icon and Action to be performed on click specified in the Script. **Actions Layout** can be defined in terms of _Title_, _Position_ - first or last column, column **Width** and **Class** can be specified.

## Usage Example

We will add a Row Action to display an alert message on click. [![dt_actions_run2](/learn/assets/dt_actions_run2-1024x640.png)](/learn/assets/dt_actions_run2.png)

- Add Row Action and set the Action to trigger Javascript, click the message to open Script [![dt_actions](/learn/assets/dt_actions.png)](/learn/assets/dt_actions.png)
- The Action will be a JS function as shown below. Here we have written a function to display an alert dialog. The name of the function is the action field entry in the custom button created earlier.
    
    Application.$controller("grid1Controller", \["$scope",
        function($scope) {
            "use strict";
            $scope.ctrlScope = $scope;
            $scope.sample = function() {
                alert('Hello');
            }
        }
    \]);
    
    [![dt_actions_js](/learn/assets/dt_actions_js-1024x640.png)](/learn/assets/dt_actions_js.png)

Role-based Access to ColumnsIf you [security has been enabled](/learn/app-security/#permissions) in your app, then you can define the app role which has access to a specific column.

[![dt_security](/learn/assets/dt_security.png)](/learn/assets/dt_security.png)Using the Data Table call back EventsData Grid has few methods exposed on widget scope which can be accessed via JavaScript. Data Table behavior can be customised with the help of the call-back events. These events can be accessed from the events tab on the Properties panel. The trigger for the event can be JavaScript, another Variable call etc..

Using the Data Table MethodsData Grid has few methods exposed on widget scope which can be accessed via JavaScript. For the following script samples, we are considering the hrdb Department table. DepartmentGrid is bound to the Live Variable corresponding to the Department table.

- To change display name of column:

$scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.columns.deptId.displayName = ‘Deptarment Id’; 
//Will change the display name of deptid column to ‘Department Id’.

- To force re-render datatable:
    
    $scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.redraw(true); 
    //Will force re-render data table.
    
- To change edit mode field value:
    
    $scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.formfields.name.value = 'Engineering 1'; 
    // Sets ‘Engineering 1’ to name edit field Note: This will work only on click of edit on a row.
    
- To select a row:
    
    $scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.selectItem(1); 
    // The parameter can be index or object of row
    
- To deselect a row: Note: deselect will work only for data table with multiselect enabled on it.

$scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.deselectItem(1);                                                    //It can be index or object of row (data bound to row), For grid actions user can send $row (which is row data) , that can be sent as an argument to this method.

- Working with selected item:
    
    $scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.selecteditem = 2; 
    //Selects the third row or item          
    $scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.selecteditem = \[2, 3\]; 
    //Selects the third and fourth row/item 
    $scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.selecteditem = \[\]; 
    //Deselects the existing rows or items
    
- Set filter mode:
    
    $scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.filtermode = ‘search’; 
    // To set filter mode as search                                                                                       $scope.Widgets.DepartmentGrid.filtermode = ‘multicolumn’; 
    //To set filter mode as multi column
