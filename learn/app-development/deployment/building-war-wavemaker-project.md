This guide helps to create a war file for deploying the project in your local machine or a web server like Apache Tomcat.

System prerequisites:

1. Java (version 1.8)
2. Node (version 10.12.0)
3. mvn (version 3.3.0)

## Generating a War file

- Step-1: Export the project as zip.

- Step-2: Extract the downloaded zip file.
- Step-3: Get the project location path.
- Step-4: In the command line, type the following command. See the image below:

- Step-5: Run the following command where _<profileName>_ should either be **development** or **deployment**.

mvn clean install -PprofileName

**Note-1:** Wavemaker project has two default profiles, which are **development** and **deployment**. Prefix the profile name with a **P**. If you do not prefix the profile name; the system selects a **development** profile by default. You can add Custom Profiles from the **Config Profiles** section in the **Project Settings** options. To locate the existing profiles' path, go to Step-7.

- Step-6: In the project folder, a new folder called **target** generates automatically with the project war file in it.

**Note-2:** The Step-6 happens on successful build completion. On build failure due to the out-of-memory error, the profile property called **build.ui.node.args** should be adjusted; this configures the build. Increase the **max-old-space-size** memory value where the default value is 512 MB. The build should be triggered again after increasing the memory value. To do this, do the following steps:

- Step-7: Go to the project folder -> profiles -> open the file _<profilename.properties>_. As shown in the image below:

- Step-8: Adjust the value of **build.ui.node.args.** See the image below:

- Step-9: Re-do the steps 5 and 6.

From WaveMaker 10.0, you can deploy your app with new build options. For more information, see [Build Options for Deployment](/learn/app-development/build-options-app-deployment/).
