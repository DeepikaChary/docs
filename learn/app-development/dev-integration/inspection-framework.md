Inspection framework is available since WaveMaker 10.0. Inspection Framework helps you locate errors, custom code or any unsupported methods in your project. For example, you can use this feature for the project migration process to identify unsupported methods. Using the inspection framework, you can perform tests and include this feature in your QA cycle to help you find code errors. Also, with this, you can point to the project’s custom code and edit and fix any code errors you may have. 

## How to use Inspection Framework

You can locate Inspection framework from the More options menu located on the bottom-left corner when you open a project. See the image below:

![](/learn/assets/inspectionframeworklowcode.png)

To initiate the inspection framework, you click the More options menu and click Run. When you run the inspection framework from your project, if there are any unsupported methods or errors in your code, it shows them on the screen immediately. The following guide helps you with each rule that Inspection Framework will help you identify and fix the issues in your project.

## No AngularJS Service

This rule attempts to catch and prevent any usage of AngularJS Service.

### Rule Details

If you want to remove AngularJS service this rule can help you by warning you of any usage of AngularJS service in your app.

#### That includes:

Application.service(‘myService’, function() {});

For replacing AngularJS service, we can use objects defined on the App.

#### Examples of incorrect code for this rule

Application.service(‘myService’, function($rootScope) {
this.someFunction = function() {
	...
	$rootScope.x
	...
}
});

### Use

Application.$controller(‘$scope’, ‘myService’ function($scope, myService) {
myService.someFunction();
});

#### Examples of correct code for this rule

App.myService = {
	someFunction: function() {
		…
	App.x //$rootScope to be replaced with App
	...
	}
}

### Use

App.myService.someFunction();

For replacing the AngularJS controller, we can use Prefabs.
Examples of incorrect code for this rule:
Application.controller("myCtrl", function ($scope) {
    $scope.firstName = "Alex";
    $scope.lastName = "Bob";
});

### Use

		console.log(‘in display method’);
	}
};
});

### Use

‘myFactory’.displayMethod();

#### Examples of correct code for this rule:

Define the factory in app.js. Any AngularJS dependency being used in the factory will NOT work. That has to be defined separately in app.js before defining the factory.

App.myFactory = {
	someFunction: function() {
		…
