    .wm-app .app-header {
        background-color: green;
    }
    .wm-app .app-footer {
        background-color: yellow;
    }
    .wm-app .navbar {
        background-color: red;
    }
    .wm-app .app-left-panel {
        background-color: gray;
    }
    .wm-app .app-right-panel {
        background-color: black;
    }
